1. Throughly compare and contrast malloc() and calloc(). Make sure to include details about parameters, return values, etc.
	malloc: format = (castType) malloc (sizeInBytes);
		takes only one argument
		requires no inilization 
		use memset () to set memory to 0 
	calloc: format = (castType) calloc (blocks, sizeOfBlocks);
		takes two arguments 
		initializes allocates memory to 0 

2. How would you determine the size of an allocated portion of memory?
	We could use sizeof and our pointer /* ?? */

3. Why do you have to free memory on the heap but not on the stack?
	You have to free memory on the heap because if you dont, it will cause a memory leak. Memory on the stack is automatically freed when the function terminates. 

4. Why do you need to test the return value from malloc?
	To test if memory has been successfully allocated
