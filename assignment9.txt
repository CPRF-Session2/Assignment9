1. Compare malloc() and calloc()
	Calloc zero-initializes the buffer to 0, while malloc leaves the memory unitialized. Also, malloc takes in a single argument, while calloc needs two arguments. Both malloc and calloc return  pointers to allocated memory on success, or NULL on failure. They are both functions of memory allocation. 

2. How would you determine the size of an allocated portion of memory?
	You can use the sizeof operator.

3. Why do you have to free memory on the heap, but not on the stack?
	On the stack, the memory it allocated during compilation of the program, and the freeing of blocks is systematic. On the heap, the memory is allocated during the runtime.

4. Why do you need to test the return value from malloc?
	You need to test it because it might overcommit memory. Also, the elements are not intialized.
